    "➡️ In this project, our objective is to assist Megaline in enhancing its customer experience by recommending more suitable plans to subscribers currently using legacy options. We will analyze the behavior of users who have already transitioned to Megaline's newer plans—Smart and Ultra—and develop a predictive model designed to identify the most appropriate plan for each subscriber.<br><br> \n",
    "We will utilize behavioral data from subscribers who have already switched to the new plans. With the data preprocessing phase already completed, our focus will be on constructing and fine-tuning a classification model to accurately predict the best plan for each user.<br><br>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**:\n",
    "  - Logistic Regression showed **poor performance** with both **training** and **validation accuracy** values below 0.4. This suggests that the model is **underfitting** and unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data, making it unsuitable for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)**:\n",
    "  - The **Decision Tree** model provided **good performance** with a **training accuracy of 0.7981** and **validation accuracy of 0.7905**. The gap between training and validation accuracy is **minimal**, indicating that the model is **not overfitting**. The Decision Tree also offers high **interpretability**, making it a suitable choice for understanding how features influence the target variable. However, its performance in terms of accuracy was not as high as that of **Random Forest**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forest (RF)**:\n",
    "  - The **Random Forest** model performed well on the **training set** with an accuracy of **0.9795**, but it showed a **significant drop in validation accuracy** (0.7925), suggesting **overfitting**. Despite this, it obtained the **highest validation accuracy** compared to other models, making it the most reliable model for making predictions, especially when **fine-tuned**.\n",
    "  - Additionally, the **Random Forest model** exceeded the project’s **accuracy threshold of 0.75**, achieving **validation accuracy of 0.7925**, which aligns with the primary goal of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final Decision:\n",
    "- Based on the evaluation results, we have chosen the **Random Forest** model with **n_estimators=8**. This model demonstrated the best balance between **performance** and **accuracy** on the validation set, despite showing signs of **overfitting** in the training set. It **meets the project’s accuracy goal** and, with further **hyperparameter tuning**, has the potential to perform even better, especially in predicting the **Ultra users**, which is critical for this project.\n",
